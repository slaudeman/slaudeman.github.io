        <h1>Durandian Shape Grammars</h1>
		<h3>A Language of Town Halls in the Style of Durand</h3>
		
		<h5>Laudeman, Sara M<br /> <br />ARCH 8866 AE | Fall 2020 | Georgia Institute of Technology</h5>
        <p>Durand is known to this day for his rigorous descriptions of the proper methods for
assembling buildings of many types. The first half of this studio investigation, titled Durandian
Shape Grammars, focuses on the typological guidelines set forth in the Precis with regards to Town
Halls.</p>
		<p>The program elements of the Town Hall are broken down both formally and
programatically. Durand highlights the need for office rooms, gallerias for access, and a municipal
hall in this typology in addition to the typical parts of a building he specifies throughout the Precis.</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>“The size of these buildings varies in accordance with the size of the towns in which they are built.
We offer as an example a town hall for a place of modest size, in order to show, as with the
preceding design, that, although in architecture, as in everything, magnitude is one of the qualities
that strike us the most forcibly, a building in which it must necessarily be absent may still be
beautiful, providing that the requirements of fitness are fulfilled as they ought to be.”</p>
			<p align="right">Durand, “Precis”</p>
		</blockquote>

    <p>A deconstructive sequence highlights the wall centerlines of key building parts: in Durand’s
	language, these are the room, the galleria, the portico, the vestibule, and the stair. Together, the
	relational lines, common axes, and building organization imply a room symmetry parti as above. This
	investigation guides the development of the rules of a durandian shape grammar.</p>

		<p>Basic sets of constructive rules are used in the Shape Machine to develop room blocks, which 
	are then applied over a second set of rules to create assemblies.</p>
	
	<div class="section-container-spacer">

    </div>
	
	              <p>Starting from the spatial symmetry parti, a series of rules can be applied to locate the
part boundaries around the lines of symmetry. These rules are the basic premise of the language.
From there, the constructed parts from the previous pages can be applied in various ways based on
the perimeter conditions of the parts. In the rules constructed for this project, the Rhinoceros
layers are used as “labels” to call out different parts. A series of rules are applied to add offices,
gallerias, and vestibules in turn. As a simplification, the entire entry sequence is applied as a single
rule. Porticos, stairs, and vestibules are combined into a single condition. The continuation of the
language is a series of hall rules. These rules define columns, vaults, engaged columns, and pilasters
if there are any. Finally, “cleaner” rules are applied and external stairs are placed on the entry
conditions.</p>
