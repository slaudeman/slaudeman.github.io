        <h1>Electronic House</h1>
		<h3>An Active and Ballardian Communal Work-Live Experiment</h3>
		
		<h5>Laudeman, Sara M; Li, Yuhang; McClelland, Marta <br /> ARCH 8866 LS | Spring 2020 | Georgia Institute of Technology</h5>
        <p>The psychotropic house, as in J.G. Ballard’s “The Thousand Dreams of Stellavista,” serves
as the primary motivation for this project. The Electronic House suggests that the relationship between the inhabitants and the architecture is a game which
then creates spaces of interplay and internal tension. In order to frame this discussion, the project
uses the idea of a work/play artists commune. The residency length is selected by inhabitants and
ranges between 4 weeks and one year. Clusters are created from a cellular grid (architecture) based
on agent (inhabitant) actions as well as the occupancy level. These clusters are then transformed
across the playing field according to a set of rules. There are rules for the effect that agents have,
rules for the effect that clusters have, and rules for the way the house itself interacts within the
field. This creates spaces of constructive awkwardness and direct tension, causing the inhabitants
and the architecture to work with and against one anotherin turn. Practically , this means that the
house is constantly shifting as it responds to the habits, patterns, and uses of its inhabitants. This
means that there might be fewer issues of lost space, and that the issues of habit and play (or memory
and fantasy) are balanced against one another.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In the formative phase of the project, different terms are defined as the architectural brain works
to create a landscape for communal living. The cells are the individual grid elements of the playing
field. The entirety of the architecture is composed based on these cells. Clusters are highlighted
groups of cells, which are referred to as activated in this phase. Clusters are created based on
agent, or inhabitant, actions and motions. That is to say that the formation of clusters ismovement
given form,based on the behavioral patterns of inhabitants. Each cluster then functions under a set
of seven major rules. Clusters can combine, break apart if they become too large, and absorb smaller
“useless” clusters below a certain size threshold. Agents can cause clusters to copy themselves,
mirror themselves, or perform a hyb rid copy/mirror action. Finally , clusters move across the
playing field in orthogonal or diagonal paths, which themselves are visualized through the field
reactions. Clusters near one another will then move towards each other while other clusters move
towardsareas of lower density in a pseudo-flock interaction.</p>

              <p>Developing a diagrammatic relationship is only half of the process. To
bring these two-dimensional boards into architectural concepts, the
project relies on another dichotomy. Drawing from the ideas of urbanism,
Waddington’s creodes, and Gould’s intermediate forms, two surfaces
are developed: an urban form, which contains the clusters as they are
constructed of cells, and a landscape form, which creates dramatic hills
and valleys from the same cells.</p>
				<p>These forms can be taken to represent the memory and fantasy
components of the machine respectively . When combined, the urban
landscape form provides a work-play balance between useable plateaus
–which map directly to the white space referenced before –and the
playful landscape features whichrepresent machine’s randomized input
or machine’s fantasies that break the memorized patterns of plateauboulevard
relationship.The house uses these irregularities to combat
agent interactions by disrupting the urban plateaus</p>
			  <ol>
                <li>Tendency: The space transitions from fewer large plateaus to more small ones. As movement rails
become more distant from one another, they split into more small boulevards.</li>
                <li>Interaction: As clusters converge, merge, and split, the boulevards, plazas, and plateaus combine,
diverge, and shift to create areas of different interactions.</li>
                <li>Characteristic: The lower (more private) spaces have less exposure than the higher (more public)
spaces. The boulevards function as connections between the two with direct exposure to the clusters.</li>
              </ol>
			  <p>As the clusters move, they drag the boulevards with them, functioning as transient anchors for
the landscape. Tracking the relationships between plazas and plateaus over one year shows the
agglomeration and decay of spaces in direct response to cluster movement and inhabitant activities.</p>

     </div>
	
	<p>Clusters and plateaus are predefined
features of the landscape and attract
groups of individuals. However, they also
transform in time. Boulevards between
clusters, plateaus, and plazas are full of
potential. Since clusters move extremely
slowly , the boulevards become spaces for
spontaneous gatherings and temporary
activities.</p>
	<p>Fantasy: all registered deviations from the
memorized pattern. These fantasies create
vertical modification of the landscape. Flat
surfaces are interrupted by hills as they
emerge. This results in geometric vagueness
of the hills, allowing unexpected scenarios
and uses of space. Work spaces become play
spaces and vice versa.</p>
	<p>In order to develop a cave-like landscape and prevent interruption with columns, 
	the project utilizes a spaceframe structure with a triple-layer grid composed of 2m
	x 1m modules. The structural system supports the operable cell mechanisms and the cells 
	themselves. An accessible basement level allows for maintenance, and the façade is 
	composed of rotating panels that capture sunlight and store the energy in the façade 
	cells. The clusters and cells move within this framework, creating variations within 
	the forms discussed above. Clusters vary in height to accommodate different uses, while 
	plateaus and plazas shift slightly in 6” increments to allow easy access. The cells are 
	supported by scissor lifts which can raise and lower the surface. Floor cells have integrated 
	walls which slide to allow access to the interior of clusters, while overhead cells house 
	lights behind frosted glass panels.</p>

		<p>The Electronic House subverts the expectations of a traditional living situation on many levels. From the
communal living aspect to the transient phys ical states, the House forces its inhabitants to adapt even
as it responds to those adaptations and shifts again.This project attempts to connect disparate concepts
and shifting expectations from both the inhabitants and the architecture. Through this unconventional
approach, the Electronic House challenges the notion of passive architecture. It combines the modernist
ideas of adaptable buildings with advanced capabilities of 21st century technologies and it explores
solutions for underoccupancy, adaptability, and transformability of the built environment. The project
attempts to prove that through interaction, learning, and adapting both architectureand inhabitants - as
two equal entities - can create spaces full of unexpected conditions where memories and fantasies coexist.</p>
