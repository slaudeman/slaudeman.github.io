        <h1>Electronic House</h1>
		<h3>An Active and Ballardian Communal Work-Live Experiment</h3>
		
		<h5>Laudeman, Sara M; Li, Yuhang; McClelland, Marta <br /> <br />ARCH 8866 LS | Spring 2020 | Georgia Institute of Technology</h5>
        <p>The psychotropic house, as in J.G. Ballard’s “The Thousand Dreams of Stellavista,” serves
		as the primary motivation for this project. The Electronic House suggests that the relationship between the inhabitants and the 
		architecture is a game which then creates spaces of interplay and internal tension. In order to frame this discussion, the project 
		uses the idea of a work/play artists' commune. The residency length is selected by inhabitants and ranges between 4 weeks and one year. 
		The occupants and their visitors act within, react to, and interact with the architecture around them on a daily basis. In this project, 
		both short-term and long-term patterns of use are considered as motivators for the architecture. </p>
		
		<p>The architecture is pixelated on a 1m x 1m scale. This cellular grid becomes the architectural "brain" of the project. There are a handful 
		of important terms to define in the context of this exploration. First, <strong>clusters</strong> are created from a cellular grid (architecture) 
		based on <strong>agent</strong> (inhabitant) actions as well as the occupancy level. These clusters are then transformed across the grid, or 
		<strong>playing field</strong> according to a set of rules. There are rules for the effect that agents have, rules for the effect that clusters 
		have, and rules for the way the house itself interacts within the field. This creates spaces of constructive awkwardness and direct tension, 
		causing the inhabitants and the architecture to work with and against one another in turn. Practically , this means that the house is constantly 
		shifting as it responds to the habits, patterns, and uses of its inhabitants. This means that there might be fewer issues of lost space, and 
		that the issues of habit and play (or memory and fantasy) are balanced against one another.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In the formative phase of the project, different terms are defined as the architectural brain works
	to create a landscape for communal living. The cells are the individual grid elements of the playing
	field. The entirety of the architecture is composed based on these cells. Clusters are highlighted
	groups of cells, which are referred to as activated in this phase. Clusters are created based on
	agent, or inhabitant, actions and motions. That is to say that the formation of clusters is movement
	given form based on the behavioral patterns of inhabitants. Each cluster then functions under a set
	of seven major rules. Clusters can combine, break apart if they become too large, and absorb smaller
	“useless” clusters below a certain size threshold. Agents can cause clusters to copy themselves,
	mirror themselves, or perform a hybrid copy/mirror action. Finally, clusters move across the
	playing field in orthogonal or diagonal paths, which themselves are visualized through the field
	reactions. Clusters near one another will then move towards each other while other clusters move
	towardsareas of lower density in a pseudo-flock interaction.</p>

				<p>Developing a diagrammatic relationship is only half of the process. To
				bring these two-dimensional fields into architectural concepts, the
				project relies on another dichotomy. Drawing from the ideas of urbanism,
				Waddington’s creodes, and Gould’s intermediate forms, two surfaces
				are developed: an urban form, which contains the clusters as they are
				constructed of cells, and a landscape form, which creates dramatic hills
				and valleys from the same cells.</p>
				
				<p>These forms can be taken to represent the memory and fantasy
				components of the machine respectively. When combined, the urban
				landscape form provides a work-play balance between useable plateaus
				– which map directly to the white space referenced before – and the
				playful landscape features which represent a more fantastic landscape which
				disrupts the regular, urban patterns and relationships of plateaus and boulevards. 
				The house uses these irregularities to counter agent interactions by disrupting the urban plateaus.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Tendency: The space transitions from fewer large plateaus to more small ones. As movement rails
					become more distant from one another, they split into more small boulevards.</li>
					<li>Interaction: As clusters converge, merge, and split, the boulevards, plazas, and plateaus combine,
					diverge, and shift to create areas of different interactions.</li>
					<li>Characteristic: The lower (more private) spaces have less exposure than the higher (more public)
					spaces. The boulevards function as connections between the two with direct exposure to the clusters.</li>
				</ol>
			  
				<p>As the clusters move, they drag the boulevards with them, functioning as transient anchors for
				the landscape. Tracking the relationships between plazas and plateaus over one year shows the
				agglomeration and decay of spaces in direct response to cluster movement and inhabitant activities.</p>

		<br />
	
		<p>Clusters and plateaus are predefined features of the landscape and attract groups of individuals. However, they also
		transform over time. Boulevards between clusters, plateaus, and plazas are full of potential. Since clusters move extremely
		slowly, the boulevards often become spaces for spontaneous gatherings and temporary activities.</p>
		
		<p>Fantasy: all registered deviations from the memorized pattern. These fantasies create vertical modification of the landscape. Flat
		surfaces are interrupted by hills as they emerge. This results in geometric vagueness of the hills, allowing unexpected scenarios
		and uses of space. In this way, work spaces become play spaces and vice versa.</p>
		
		<p>In order to develop a cave-like landscape and prevent interruption with columns, the project utilizes a spaceframe structure with a triple-layer 
		grid composed of 2m x 1m modules. The structural system supports the operable cell mechanisms and the cells themselves. An accessible basement 
		level allows for maintenance, and the façade is composed of rotating panels that capture sunlight and store the energy in the façade 
		cells. The clusters and cells move within this framework, creating variations within the forms discussed above. Clusters vary in height to 
		accommodate different uses, while plateaus and plazas shift slightly in 6” increments to allow easy access. The cells are supported by scissor 
		lifts, which can raise and lower the surface readily. Floor cells have integrated walls which slide to allow access to the interior of clusters, 
		while overhead cells house lights behind frosted glass panels.</p>

		<p>The Electronic House subverts the expectations of a traditional living situation on many levels. From the
		communal living aspect to the transient physical states, the House forces its inhabitants to adapt even
		as it responds to those adaptations and shifts again. This project attempts to connect disparate concepts
		and shifting expectations from both the inhabitants and the architecture. Through this unconventional
		approach, the Electronic House challenges the notion of passive architecture. It combines the modernist
		ideas of adaptable buildings with advanced capabilities of 21st century technologies and it explores
		solutions for underoccupancy, adaptability, and transformability of the built environment. The project
		attempts to prove that through interaction, learning, and adapting architecture and inhabitants - as
		two equal entities - can create spaces full of unexpected conditions where memories and fantasies coexist.</p>
